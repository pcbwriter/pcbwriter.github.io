                In order to develop the PCBWriter into a device that is easy for others to use and copy, we organized a hackathon at <a href="http://www.dingfabrik.de/">Dingfabrik, Cologne</a> in December 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
            During the hackathon, we worked on the following projects:
            <ul>
            <li>Improved documentation.</li>
            <li>A problem with timing jitter between different polygon mirror rotations was investigated more closely.</li>
            <li>A number of different polygon mirror assemblies from laser printers were analyzed. We learned about the existance of a PLL-type motor driver that looks to be more suitable for our project.</li>
            <li>A Windows port of the host software was started. During that, we found and investigated a strange USB bug.</li>
            <li>We started making plans for a PCBWriter kit that can be produced on a laser cutter.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The results will hopefully find their way into the official repository shortly...
