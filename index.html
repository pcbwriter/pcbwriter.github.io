                The PCBWriter uses a laser diode to directly expose the photoresist on PCBs. The direct exposure technique removes a lot of the typical problems with toner transfer or laser printer transparencies, allowing to reliably create PCBs even with the small structures needed for todays chips.
            </p>
            <h3>Status</h3>
            <p>
            The PCBWriter is currently under development. A first version has been constructed and successfully exposed PCBs. We are currently working on fixing bugs and on various improvements to hard- and software.
            </p>
            <p>
            A similar device has been developed at <a href="http://www.das-labor.org/wiki/LaserExposer">Das Labor</a> in Bochum. Experience there shows that the technique is indeed able to produce very fine structures with high fidelity.
