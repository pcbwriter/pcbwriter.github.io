            <h2>The workshop</h2>
            <p>
                We will shortly be offering a workshop where participants can build their own PCBWriter for use in their own workshop or local Hackerspace/Fablab. It will take place at <a href="http://www.dingfabrik.de">Dingfabrik</a> in Cologne, Germany. The workshop will probably be partly funded by <a href="http://www.vdi.de">VDI</a> and BMBF (awaiting confirmation). Depending on funding details, the cost for one PCBWriter will be around 100 - 200€. We anticipate that two or three participants will be building one device together.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are currently planning to have the workshop on one or two weekends (Friday evening - Sunday). Given the amount of work still needed for development and organization, it will probably happen at some time in August 2013 or later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information on the workshop will be posted on this website as they become available. If you are potentially interested, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:pcbwriter@dingfabrik.de">pcbwriter@dingfabrik.de</a>; we will notify you once we know more.
            </p>
            <p>
                For members of Fablabs in Germany, travel and lodging costs may be covered by the <a href="http://www.offene-werkstaetten.org/">"Verbund offener Werkstätten"</a>.
